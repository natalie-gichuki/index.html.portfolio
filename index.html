    <h1>NATALIE'S RESUME</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <P>To contribute in the development of sustainable business practices in all businesses worldwide by utilising my Website Development skills to create functional websites for them to use in displaying their business's ideas.</P>
     <hr/>
    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Primary School</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kabati Central Academy ( Kindergarten-Class 7) 2011-2019</li>
            <li>Kerugoya GoodShepherd Academy ( Class 7-Class 8) 2019-2021</li>
            <p>>In 2021 I did my National exam(KCPE) and scored 411/500</p>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Highschool</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maryhill Girls Highschool (Form 1-Form 4) 2021-2024</li>
            <p>>In 2024 I did my National exam and scored an A of 83 points</p>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>>I'm just from completing highschool hence I've not yet been employed but in school I participated in several clubs</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Science Congress Club</h3></li>
        <p>>Here my partner and I designed and programmed an Ambubag Auto Respirator.<br/>
           This is a cheap and easy to use respirator to serve as an alternative to ventilators in the marginal parts of our country. This is because ventilators are expensive to purchase and require high expertise to operate which is mostly not available in the marginal areas. The Ambubag hence offers an alternative to save patients with breathing difficulties in the marginal areas.<br/>
           We were able to test it out on several students in our school and it worked efficiently but cannot yet be released for the world to use as it has not been tested by the experienced engineers and doctors.</p><br/>
           <p>>We also presented the Ambubag project to the Kids Conference held in Australia and got a standing ovation from the judges and the participants online. We were then awarded certificates</p>
        <li><h3>Personal Projects</h3></li> 
        <p>Once I finished highschool I immediately started training on Web Development and I've done one complete project so far on my 18th birthday plan which is attached to my resume.</p>
